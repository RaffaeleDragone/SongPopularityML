# Song Popularity Prediction
![SongPopularity](images/songs.jpg)
## Description:

Music has a profound connection with humans. It can uplift mood, alleviate pain and anxiety, and provide avenues for emotional expression. Research suggests that music can positively impact our physical and mental well-being in various ways.

Lately, numerous studies have been conducted to comprehend song popularity based on various factors. These studies analyze music samples and record parameters to forecast song popularity. This project aims to predict song popularity based on attributes like energy, acoustics, instrumentalness, liveliness, and danceability. The dataset is extensive and complex due to strong multicollinearity. Can we overcome these challenges and construct an effective predictive model?

## Acknowledgments:
The dataset used in this project has been sourced from Kaggle.

## Objective:
- Understand the dataset and perform data cleaning if necessary.
- Build regression models to predict song popularity.

## Overview:

We aim to address this problem statement by following an action plan with the following steps:

1. Data Exploration
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Data Manipulation
5. Predictive Modeling

## Model Building:

### Linear Regression:

A linear regression model has been constructed to predict song popularity.

### Decision Tree Regressor:

A decision tree regressor model has been implemented and trained.

### Random Forest Regressor:

A random forest regressor model has been built and trained.

### Polynomial Regression:

Polynomial regression has been applied to capture non-linear relationships in the data.

## Model Evaluation:

Models have been evaluated on the test dataset to assess their performance.

## Hyperparameter Tuning:

GridSearchCV has been utilized to find the best hyperparameters for the Random Forest Regressor.

## Final Model:

The best model has been selected and evaluated using the test data.

## Neural Network Model:

A neural network model has been developed using TensorFlow/Keras for regression.

## Conclusion:

The project's results and findings have been summarized. Contributions, issue reporting, and feedback are welcome to improve this project.
